## Repository Structure

- **Data/**  
  Contains raw and processed datasets used in the project.  
  Example files:  
  - `Read me.md` (describes dataset content and usage)

- **Docs/**  
  Documentation, reports, and research notes.  
  Example files:  
  - `Brief.md` (short project description or summary)

- **Script/**  
  Source code and analysis scripts used for experiments and simulations.  
  Example files:  
  - `Script1.md` (example placeholder script description)

## Guidelines for Collaboration

1. **File Naming Convention**  
   - Use clear and consistent names:  
     ```
     YYYYMMDD_ProjectAbbreviation_FileType_Version.Extension
     ```
     Example: `20250916_GenAI_Data_v1.csv`

2. **Commit Messages**  
   - Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., *"Add initial data folder with README"*).  
   - Keep messages short but descriptive.

3. **Branching**  
   - Create new branches for major updates or experiments.  
   - Use informative names like `feature-dataset-cleaning` or `analysis-modelA`.

4. **Contributions**  
   - Document changes in the `Docs/` folder.  
   - Ensure code in `Script/` is commented and reproducible.
